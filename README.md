# M2 Shell Tools
A small collection of shell scripts to make my life easier while using the Monkey2 Programming Language (http://monkeycoder.co.nz).

These scripts were created for OS X, but should work well in Linux with minor modifications. Make sure you set the M2 path correctly at the top of the scripts when necessary.

You can create symlinks for each script on /usr/local/bin and set each link to executable with "chmod a+x scriptname".
